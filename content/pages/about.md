### What is Together At Home Club?
A collection of free and discounted resources to keep you staying at home. Generously offered by companies and creators around the world in the midst of COVID-19 outbreak.

### How to submit new free resources?
I'm open for new content suggestion via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/B6yXL7xEUSKTnLY98) right now, but I'm working on a way to let everyone submit their content. Stay tuned! 

### How can I keep posted on new free resources?
Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@tgtathomeclub) or [RSS](http://tgtathome.club/rss.xml).

### Who made this website?
My name is [Samuel](https://www.twitter.com/@desktopofsamuel), I'm a UI/UX designer based in Hong Kong. I made this project while staying most of my weeks at home, many companies and creators are sharing their work for people stuck at home and I wouldn't want to miss them so I'm collecting everything I saw in this website. 

### What did you use to make this?
This site is created using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/?ref=togetherathomeclub) with [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?ref=togetherathomeclub). This site is adapted from [Gatsby Starter Lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/).
